# atom-react-alt-templates

Most credit goes to Alexey Sokolov who made the nice package [atom-smart-template](https://github.com/AlexeySokolov/atom-smart-template).

This package adds some predefined React templates to the templating engine.

* React components with CSS-modules and a test file
* Alt actions and stores
