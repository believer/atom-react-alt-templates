# atom-react-alt-templates

All credit goes to [Alexey Sokolov](https://github.com/AlexeySokolov) who made the nice package [atom-smart-template](https://github.com/AlexeySokolov/atom-smart-template), I'm just expanding his great code.

This package adds some predefined React templates to the templating engine.

**NOTE**: Seems to be incompatible with [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io/) at the moment.

### Usage
Right click the folder where you want to add files and select **Create files from template**

### Alt
* Action with a test
* Store with tests

### React
* Container component with tests
* Project setup
* Custom validator
* Dumb component (aka Functional stateless component)
* Smart component (ES6 class)

Dumb and smart components come in both a format with and without a wrapping folder. All React templates contain at least one test. Dumb and smart components also include a CSS file.
